🟢 Day 4 — Study Mode & UI Discipline

## What I Accomplished

- Implemented a Study Mode toggle feature in the browser interface
- Created functionality to hide non-essential UI elements (top bar) in Study Mode
- Enabled content (web pages/PDFs) to expand to full window height
- Resolved layout issues by adopting a flex-based UI design
- Fixed a white strip issue at the bottom when toggling Study Mode by replacing fixed height calculations with CSS Flexbox
- Wrapped the webview in a flexible content container for automatic resizing

## Key Concepts Learned

- UI problems in desktop applications frequently stem from layout calculation errors
- Flexbox provides more reliable dynamic UI behavior compared to fixed height calculations
- Removing UI elements can enhance user focus without increasing complexity
- Effective user experience often involves feature subtraction rather than addition

## Main Takeaway

Study Mode enhances focus by deliberately minimizing UI elements, while a flex-based layout ensures the application maintains visual consistency and responsiveness.
